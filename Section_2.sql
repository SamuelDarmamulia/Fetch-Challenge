/* TOSTITOS is the clear leader in the Dips & Salsa category, generating $181.30 in total sales with 38 units sold across 36 transactions, making it both the highest-grossing and most frequently purchased brand.

   If I were to create a dashboard/chart for this insight, I would create a triple bar chart that has the three aggregations broken down by each brand, so the stakeholders can see the differences easily. 
   If one of the metrics is of a higher priority, then I would do a normal bar chart to make things less confusing for the stakeholders. */
